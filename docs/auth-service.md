# Auth Service (`apps/auth/`)

This fork also supports `AUTH_MODE=local` for a single pre-created browser account with WebAuthn passkeys. See [self-hosted local authentication](self-hosted-local-auth.md) for bootstrap, recovery, configuration, and verification. Local mode does not mount the Cognito, native, demo, or OAuth login routes described below.

The remaining sections describe upstream email + OTP authentication via AWS Cognito.

- `AUTH_MODE`: `local` for the self-hosted browser provider, `none` for explicitly insecure local development, or `cognito` for upstream JWT verification.
- Account identity: an account's `user_id` is a surrogate identifier the product owns, and
  `auth.user_identities` maps a Cognito subject to it. The two are not required to be equal, and the
  id is not derived from the subject; the column rule lives in
  `db/migrations/0159_surrogate_user_identity.sql`. Where a mapping row exists, its `user_id` is the
  account id.
  - A new account gets a minted id. An account that already exists keeps the id it has, the subject
    itself included, and is never rewritten onto a new one.
  - An account can have an `org.user_settings` row and no `auth.user_identities` row until something
    binds one. Readers resolve such an account by subject, and provisioning paths adopt it under its
    existing id and bind it rather than mint a second account.
  - An account is created by whichever path first sees the subject, so no path may assume it is the
    first, and every one of them adopts an account that already exists rather than minting a second.
    The first authenticated backend request (`apps/backend/src/auth/ensureUser.ts`) and an agent API
    key or OAuth/MCP connection (`apps/auth/src/server/agent/userWorkspace.ts`) are two such paths;
    a guest upgrade (`apps/backend/src/guestAuth/upgrade/`) is another, and it binds the subject to
    the id the guest session had already minted. A path that mints an id for a subject binds the
    subject to it in the same transaction, and every path that creates or binds takes one advisory
    lock keyed by the subject, so only one of them ever gets to create.
  - This service refuses a subject in `auth.deleted_subjects` with `410 ACCOUNT_DELETED`, the code
    the backend answers it with, before it resolves, adopts, or creates an account for it.
- Guest sessions (`POST /v1/guest-auth/session`) are bound to `ios`, `android`, or `web`. A `web`
  guest session is an analytics credential only, sent as `Authorization: Guest <token>` to
  `POST /v1/analytics/events` alone. It is requested by the browser, lazily on a signed-out
  visitor's first real interaction. This service requests none of its own: its sign-in funnel posts
  to the credential-free collector instead (`Login funnel analytics` below).
  - The route's own ingest contract lives in the source:
    `apps/backend/src/routes/productAnalytics.ts` owns its HTTP surface, accepted transports,
    and the `accepted`/`rejected` envelope; `apps/backend/src/productAnalytics/validation.ts`
    owns batch and per-event validation and the rejection reasons;
    `apps/backend/src/productAnalytics/catalog.ts` owns the frozen event catalog and property
    specs every client mirrors; `apps/backend/src/productAnalytics/writer.ts` owns the
    analytics connection pool and its `429 ANALYTICS_WRITER_BUSY`.
  - `apps/backend/src/guestAuth/webPlatform.ts` is the single gate. Every authenticated route builds
    its context through `loadRequestContextFromRequest`, which refuses a `web` guest platform with
    `403 GUEST_WEB_PLATFORM_UNSUPPORTED` unless the route opts in; analytics ingest is the only
    caller that does. The chat surface repeats the check because it spends AI quota, and the chat
    live stream Lambda applies it on its own auth path.
  - Guest upgrade takes the token from the request body, so it enforces the same rule against the
    loaded session record and answers `403 GUEST_UPGRADE_WEB_PLATFORM_UNSUPPORTED`.
  - Only the literal `web` is refused. A `null` platform is a pre-1.7.0 iOS/Android guest session and
    keeps every guest surface it has today.
  - `POST /v1/guest-auth/session` and `POST /v1/guest-auth/session/delete` stay open to it: they are
    the credential's own lifecycle and authenticate outside the request-context loader.
  - `POST /v1/guest-auth/identity/link` is authenticated as the signed-in account and takes the guest
    token from its body, so it accepts a `web` guest. It links that guest identity to the account for
    analytics and revokes the guest session. An unknown or already-revoked token is a successful
    no-op, and so is a guest session that already belongs to the signed-in account after a bound
    upgrade: that credential is neither linked nor revoked. Like the upgrade routes it does not load a
    request context, so it applies the `410 ACCOUNT_DELETED` gate itself, and it resolves the account
    user id from `auth.user_identities` in its own transaction rather than trusting the id on the
    request.
    - Client ordering obligation: the account's `auth.user_identities` row is written by the first
      request that loads a request context after sign-in, such as `GET /v1/me`. Nothing sequences
      that for you. Await one such call before calling this route; two requests fired in parallel
      right after a first-ever sign-in can let the link reach the database first.
    - Upgrade ordering obligation: never send a guest token here that may still need
      `POST /v1/guest-auth/upgrade/prepare` or `POST /v1/guest-auth/upgrade/complete`. This route
      revokes the guest session, and both upgrade routes refuse a revoked token with
      `401 GUEST_AUTH_INVALID`: `prepare` rejects it outright, and `complete` looks for an
      `auth.guest_upgrade_history` replay row and finds none for a session that was never upgraded.
      No data is lost, because a guest that owns anything is refused below with
      `409 GUEST_IDENTITY_LINK_UPGRADE_REQUIRED` rather than revoked, but that token's upgrade path
      is gone. Run the upgrade flow first, or reserve this route for guest credentials that exist
      only to authenticate analytics.
    - `409 GUEST_IDENTITY_LINK_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED` means exactly that ordering has not happened yet, and
      it is retryable rather than terminal. Keep the guest token, complete a request-context call, and
      call again. Never drop the guest token on this code: that guest's whole analytics tail goes with
      it, permanently.
    - `409 GUEST_IDENTITY_LINK_UPGRADE_REQUIRED` means the guest owns data the upgrade flow transfers
      and must convert through `POST /v1/guest-auth/upgrade/complete`, which writes the same
      `server_derived` link for the same pair. Terminal here; retrying it unchanged never succeeds.
    - `409 GUEST_IDENTITY_LINK_OTHER_ACCOUNT` means the guest token names a user that is already a
      different real account. Terminal: the client is holding a credential that is not its own and
      should discard it rather than retry.
    - `429 ANALYTICS_WRITER_BUSY` is not raised here. It is the analytics pool's refusal, which the
      ingest route above still answers a saturated pool with; this route uses its own transaction.
    - A `5xx` should be retried, with the guest token kept. A connection the database drops or refuses,
      a deadlock, or a saturated pool, which authentication meets before the transaction's budget
      exists, is answered `503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with `Retry-After: 1`, and a cooling-down Cognito
      JWKS refresh `503 AUTH_VERIFICATION_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE` with `Retry-After: 10`. A failure at
      commit is `500 DATABASE_COMMIT_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, whose write may still have landed; a lock
      timeout, a statement timeout and the 5s transaction budget running out are `500 INTERNAL_ERROR`.
      Neither `500` serves a delay. Retrying is safe: the link and the revoke share one commit, so a
      repeat either redoes a request that stored nothing or meets the already-revoked no-op above.
- A guest session whose user is bound in `auth.user_identities` is that account's.
  `Authorization: Guest` refuses it with `401 GUEST_AUTH_INVALID` 7 days after the binding, a grace
  for draining guest sync between upgrade `prepare` and `complete`; both upgrade routes refuse it at
  once for any subject but the bound one.
- `POST /v1/guest-auth/session` accepts an optional `idempotencyKey`. A retry carrying a key that
  still names a live session rotates that session's secret and returns the same guest user and
  workspace, so a lost response cannot leave one device with two guest identities. Client contract:
  the key must be 32 to 200 lowercase hexadecimal characters, generated from a cryptographic random
  source once per creation attempt and dropped once that attempt succeeds. Anything outside that
  shape is refused with `400 GUEST_SESSION_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_INVALID`, and an omitted key or an
  explicit JSON `null` both mean no key at all, which keeps today's behaviour of a fresh guest per
  call. The shape check is a floor, not a guarantee: it rejects obviously non-random values such as a
  fixed label or an install id in canonical UUID form, but a hyphen-stripped install id and any other
  32-character lowercase-hex constant pass it. Generating the key randomly per attempt and dropping
  it on success therefore remain client obligations, and they matter: rotation hands whoever presents
  the key a fresh valid token for that guest's user and workspace, so a key that is stable across
  attempts or guessable is a bearer credential for that guest identity.

## Login funnel analytics

`apps/auth` measures the web sign-in funnel itself, server-side, from its own route handlers. The
login page runs no analytics script and posts no event; all it contributes is the `?screen=signin`
query on the sign-in `fetch` calls it already makes (`apps/auth/src/templates/login.ts`). The events
go one per request to the credential-free collector `POST /v1/analytics/anonymous-events`
([anonymous client analytics](anonymous-client-analytics.md)), never to the `analytics` schema
directly: the `auth_app` role has no grants there and must not be given any. That route reads no
credential and authorizes the caller by `Origin` alone, which is why this service sends its
configured public auth origin explicitly on a call no browser makes.

- The steps, and the branch that observes each:
  - `screen_viewed` with `screen = signin`: `POST /api/refresh-session`
    (`apps/auth/src/routes/browser/refreshSession.ts`) on an absent `refresh` cookie — a first visit,
    a sign-out and an expired cookie alike — and on a rejected refresh token. A non-terminal refresh
    failure is rethrown as a `500` and reports nothing, so this page-view denominator is a floor.
  - `signin_code_requested`: a `POST /api/send-code` that accepted the request
    (`apps/auth/src/routes/browser/sendCode.ts`).
  - `signin_succeeded` and `signin_failed` with a `reason`: `verifyCode.ts` beside it, plus the
    demo-account and refusal branches of `sendCode.ts`.
  - Abandonment is the absence of the next step for an actor, not an event.
  - Every step is gated on that marker and on the shared `analytics_visitor` cookie; lose either and
    the funnel counts zero in silence. This service mints no visitor id and never writes that cookie,
    so the marker is the only gate it owns — keep the audit beside `signInScreenMarker` complete.
  - The producer — catalog mirror, cookie module, transport, report budgets, and the marker check
    that keeps non-funnel callers of these shared routes out — is `apps/auth/src/server/analytics/`.
- Identity: the product domain's shared `anonymous_id`, read from the `analytics_visitor` cookie and
  never written here ([analytics visitor identity](analytics-visitor-identity.md)), and nothing else.
  This origin mints no identity of its own and writes no analytics cookie; the host-only
  `__Host-analytics_guest` it used to write is now only deleted, from the browsers that still carry
  one (`apps/auth/src/server/analytics/visitorSession.ts`).
- The join: none is made here. These rows carry no `user_id`, so
  `analytics.product_events_resolved` resolves them through `first_anonymous_link` to whichever
  account the browser's shared visitor id is linked to, which the web app on the product domain is
  what links. They land at `trust_level = 'anonymous_client'`, which the admin app's trusted-actor
  filter excludes, so a report built over them must except that explicitly.
- Mandatory on every call: the browser's own `User-Agent`, forwarded verbatim. The collector stamps
  `automated_client` from that header and from nothing else, counts a missing one as automated, and
  stores no `User-Agent` beside the row to recompute from — so a report that dropped automated
  traffic would silently lose the whole funnel, permanently. A request that carries no `User-Agent`
  is not reported at all (`readBrowserUserAgent` in `signInFunnel.ts`).
- The accepted limitation: a browser holding no shared visitor id produces no funnel rows at all, and
  nothing here offers it one — a first-ever touch that is the sign-in page goes unmeasured.
- The cost: one bounded call per reported step, and no rows of any other kind.
- Deliberately not measured: the OAuth consent page at `GET /authorize`, and `app_version`.
- Querying these rows: the caveats an analyst needs are in `docs/analytics-db-access.md`.

## MCP identity

The OAuth authorization server also provides OpenID Connect discovery and
UserInfo for enterprise workspace domain restrictions. The implementation lives
in [OAuth routes](../apps/auth/src/routes/oauth/) and
[grant storage and signing](../apps/auth/src/server/oauth/). The signing key is
managed by [the auth infrastructure](../infra/aws/lib/gateways/auth-gateway.ts).

The deployed [OIDC smoke](../scripts/checks/check-oidc-smoke.mjs) runs in the MCP
post-deploy check with the configured synthetic review account. It exercises real
PKCE grants, signing, UserInfo, refresh and scope isolation. Synthetic accounts
always report an unverified email; verify the enterprise-domain flow separately
with a real mailbox. Each run registers a client labelled `OIDC smoke <run-id>`;
its review-account connection remains until explicitly revoked in the database,
because there is no OAuth connection-management HTTP API.
