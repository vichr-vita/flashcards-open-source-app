     * Sends the answer this device owes `identityKey` until that identity's column holds it.
     *
     * Runs inside the serialized slot, so no other product-analytics PATCH is outstanding while it
     * does. The loop is the other half of that guarantee: the user can still answer again while a body
     * is in flight, because the local write happens before the slot is taken, and the response then
     * acknowledges a value this device no longer holds. Sending the newer answer right here, before
     * the slot is released, is what keeps the server from settling on a value nobody chose — the debt
     * is cleared only once the acknowledged value and the owed answer agree, so a mismatch or a
     * failure always leaves a retry behind for the next refresh.
     *
     * `origin` says who asked for what this drain delivers, and every body it sends carries it. It is
     * fixed for the whole drain because it is decided by the path that reached it, not by how many
     * attempts this answer has had or how long it has been owed: a press being handled right now,
     * with the control still waiting, is `userAction`, and an answer this device is carrying from
     * before is `reconciliation`. So a first attempt that fails is already reconciled the next time a
     * refresh picks it up, seconds later or days later alike - what makes the claim "a person is
     * asking for this, now" false is that they may have answered again elsewhere since, and no
     * elapsed time makes that safer. Within one drain the claim keeps holding, including on the
     * attempt that carries an answer the person gave while the previous body was in flight.
     *
     * Handed to `send` rather than captured by each closure, even where the caller already knows it
     * as a literal: the refusal below is classified on this same value, so the body and the
     * classification cannot name different origins. A closure writing its own literal would put that
     * agreement back in two places on every call site.
     *
     * Returns nil once a response has confirmed that `identityKey`'s column holds the answer, and
     * also when the route refused a `reconciliation` for loosening what it already holds - that is
     * the guard working rather than a failure, the answer stays owed, and nothing is reported. A
     * drain that ran every attempt it has without the column agreeing, or that stopped because the
     * identity moved, returns `ProductAnalyticsPushUnsettledError` instead of falling out silently:
     * the answer is not stored, and a caller that cannot tell that apart from success reports a
     * refused privacy choice as saved.
     *
     * "Nothing is owed to `identityKey` any more" is deliberately not read as success. An identity
     * reset landing while a body is in flight re-owes the answer to the credential this install holds
     * next, which empties this identity's debt without any server having taken the value, and the
     * drain would otherwise close on an empty debt and report the choice as saved.
