/**
 Builds the demo card answer from the localized paragraphs.

 The rating label comes from the same `Again` entry the review button uses, so
 the card always names the button the reader can see. The product name is never
 localized. The three assembled paragraphs carry exactly two kinds of Markdown,
 both added here rather than in the localized values: bold around the product
 name and inline code around the rating label.

 The backticks are load-bearing. `classifyReviewContentPresentation` switches a
 card side to Markdown only on a backtick or a block-level cue, and inline
 emphasis alone never switches the mode (`docs/review-markdown-rendering.md`).
 Without the backticks this multi-paragraph text classifies as `paragraphPlain`,
 which renders verbatim, so the reader would see the literal `**` around the
 product name. Whoever removes the backticks must also remove the bold.
