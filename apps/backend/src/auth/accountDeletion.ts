 *
 * The account id survives the reset and signs in again, so no person is erased here
 * and any analytics exclusion row naming that id stays, restore included. Its billing rows and AI usage
 * facts stay under that id for the same reason: nobody has left, and stamping a purchase as belonging to
 * a deleted account would strip the review account of access it still holds.
 *
 * Surviving is not automatic. The sweep ends in `DELETE FROM org.user_settings`, which cascades any
 * `auth.user_identities` binding away with it, and the returning subject would then be minted a
 * brand-new id (`apps/backend/src/auth/ensureUser.ts`) that none of those rows name. So the profile
 * and the binding are written back under the same id before this transaction commits.
 *
 * The binding written back is not always one the cascade removed. An account can have its profile
 * and no `auth.user_identities` row until something binds one, and `appUserId` is then the subject
 * because nothing mapped it; the write is that account's adopt bind, the same one
 * `apps/backend/src/auth/ensureUser.ts` makes when it adopts such an account. Either shape leaves
 * the account under the id it already had, which is the point.
 *
 * Written back only when the sweep found an account to clear. `POST /v1/me/delete` authenticates
 * without ensuring a profile, so a configured review subject that has never been provisioned
 * reaches here with nothing to delete, and `appUserId` is then the Cognito subject itself. Writing
 * the profile and the binding on that would not restore an account, it would create a new one whose
 * id is the provider's subject rather than a minted one (`docs/auth-service.md`). A subject with no
 * account keeps it that way and is provisioned like anyone else on its next request.
 *
 * It reports no `account_deleted` for the same reason: nobody left, and the same review account is
 * reset again on every review cycle, so counting these would make the deletion metric a measure of
 * how often the review accounts are recycled.
