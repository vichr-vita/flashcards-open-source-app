 * logic lives here to stay identical across both paths.
 *
 * An agent API key or an OAuth connection can be a person's first touch of the

 * whichever path first sees a Cognito subject may have to create the account
 * behind it, so no path may assume it is the first, and every one of them must
 * adopt an account that already exists rather than mint a second. The backend's
 * first authenticated request (apps/backend/src/auth/ensureUser.ts) is one other
 * such path. They agree because they all serialize on one advisory lock per
 * subject, which this module takes too.
