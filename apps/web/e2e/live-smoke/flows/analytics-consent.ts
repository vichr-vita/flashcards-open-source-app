/**
 * Answers the jurisdiction question for this page instead of letting the runner's own location
 * answer it. The banner is owed only where `GET /v1/analytics/visitor` says consent is required, and
 * the release workflow runs this suite from a GitHub-hosted US runner, whose API Gateway source
 * address the route places outside every consent country: against the real answer the banner would
 * never appear and the scenario would fail on geography rather than on the product.
 *
 * Only the `GET` is stubbed. The `POST` the buttons make is the real call, which is what mints the
 * cookie and what the rest of the flow depends on.
 *
 * The CORS headers are part of the stub because the API is a different origin from the app: the
 * browser drops a credentialed cross-origin answer that does not carry them, and the client reads a
 * dropped answer as a transient failure rather than as consent required.

/**
 * The one scenario that runs on a browser nobody answered the consent banner for, which is the state
 * every first-time visitor is actually in. Every other flow seeds `granted` so it exercises the
 * product; without this one no smoke run would ever see the banner, the awaiting-decision gate
 * behind it, or what the bottom strip does to the page underneath.
 *
 * It uses its own context rather than the shared worker session, because the seed the worker context
 * carries is applied before the app starts and cannot be removed afterwards. A public route is
 * enough: the banner is rendered above the routes so that every surface a visitor lands on asks on
 * the same terms.
 *
 * That route is `/share` because it is a real public route that renders unconditionally in a
 * production build, which is what this suite runs against. Do not move this scenario onto a
 * `/dev/previews/...` route: those are disabled outside the dev server
 * (docs/web-invite-previews.md), and a disabled preview screen replaces the URL with the default
 * authenticated route, so the visitor lands in the authenticated shell and is redirected to the
 * login page before anything on the page can be clicked.
 *
 * It runs outside the shared fixture, so it builds its own diagnostics around its own page: a
 * failure in the release gate arrives with the same console, network and page capture its siblings
 * attach, rather than with a bare assertion message.
