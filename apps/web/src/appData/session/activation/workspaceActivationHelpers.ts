/**
 * What the entry address did with its one chance to decide the workspace — the single model this
 * whole feature is expressed in, rather than a consumed boolean each caller re-derives. The address
 * is authoritative for the first activation of the document and for nothing else, and every rule
 * about it is a state here rather than a guard of its own:
 *
 * - `unused`: nothing has consulted the address yet. Only from here does it steer an activation.
 * - `activating`: the run that arrived first is awaiting the activation, and its promise is held so
 *   an overlapping run joins that one instead of firing a second activation of the same workspace.
 *   React 19 `StrictMode` double-invokes the mount effect that calls `initialize()`, so overlapping
 *   runs are every `pnpm dev` session rather than an edge case.
 * - `activated`: the address put this account in the workspace it names. A second
 *   `resolveInitialWorkspace` — the `sessionLoadState === "error"` retry, `AccountDeletionRecovery-
 *   Gate`, a non-overlapping `StrictMode` remount — resolves to that same workspace again, so it
 *   republishes the session state it exists to publish without relocating anybody.
 * - `unavailable`: the address named a workspace the account's list does not hold. This is the only
 *   thing the gate in `App.tsx` reads, and it is recorded against the list the server answered with,
 *   never against the warm-start snapshot, so a stale snapshot cannot raise the panel.
 * - `retired`: the address has stopped being authoritative. A stored selection puts it here from
 *   wherever the address was, `unavailable` included — `chooseWorkspace`, `createWorkspace` and
 *   `deleteWorkspace` in `useWorkspaceActions.ts`, and the first default `resolveInitialWorkspace`
 *   persists for the workspace the address just activated — each of which moves the server-side
 *   default the address was competing with: that change is the newer answer, and without this the
 *   workspace picker would be answered with the unavailable panel, the address would never realign
 *   to the picked workspace, and a second `resolveInitialWorkspace` would relocate the account off
 *   the workspace it just created or raise the panel over a deletion it just performed. One call
 *   site is the exception: the first default `resolveInitialWorkspace` persists for the account's
 *   single workspace when the address named a different one deliberately does not retire, because
 *   retiring there would flip `isEntryWorkspaceUnavailable()` back to `false`, suppress the panel in
 *   `App.tsx`, and drop the user silently into their own workspace instead of telling them the
 *   address names one they cannot open. A user-driven selection retires from `unavailable` too, for
 *   the reason the picker gives above.
 *
 * A rejected activation returns to `unused` and records nothing, so the retry button resolves to the
 * workspace the link named rather than dropping the user on the account default.
 *
 * `activating` and `activated` carry whether the workspace the address named was the account's own
 * server-side default anyway, because only an activation that moved off that default is one
 * `storeWarmStartSnapshot` must refuse: that activation leaves the stored default where it was, so
 * persisting it would paint the link's workspace on the next open at an address with no `/w/`
 * segment — where nothing repoints it — until `initialize()` resolves the account default and it
 * visibly snaps back. An address naming the default is the ordinary shape of every reload once the
 * app has rewritten its own path, and refusing those too would freeze the snapshot for good.
 *
 * A first default that fails to persist leaves `activated` with `overridesAccountDefault: true`
 * although the server then holds no competing default at all, so that document refuses every
 * snapshot write. Accepted residual: the cost is one document's cold first paint, and the next open
 * resolves the default and writes again.
 *
 * An account switch retires the address wherever it is noticed, because the user id it was used for
 * is part of this record: `revalidateActiveSession` resolves the initial workspace again for the
 * account that just arrived, and that account is not the one the address was written for. Keyed here
 * rather than checked at that call site, so the rule holds for any future caller too.
 *
 * Module state rather than React state, because the three readers are not one component:
 * `warmStart.ts` runs outside React entirely, the gate reads the outcome from `App.tsx`, and
 * activation writes it from the session layer. Every write goes through
 * `writeEntryWorkspaceActivation`, which publishes it to `subscribeToEntryWorkspaceActivation`, so a
 * reader in render is told about a change rather than depending on its writer happening to update
 * session state in the same breath.
