   * publishes one any more, so such a queue fails the authenticated gate — no owner will ever equal
   * it — and fails the credential-free gate, which requires an unclaimed queue. Every flush would
   * return sending nothing, and the events would die of the 14-day TTL: exactly the returning
   * signed-out browsers the shared visitor identity exists to measure.
   *
   * It runs only where no account credential exists and none can still arrive on this load — the
   * same facts `canDeliverWithoutCredential` reads, minus the owner this releases and minus the
   * visitor identity, which retiring a dead owner does not need — so a real account's queue is never
   * touched. An account owner is deliberately not released: it can be
   * confirmed again by the next sign-in, which is what adopts those events.
   *
   * The queued events go with the owner rather than being re-sent under the visitor id: they were
   * collected under that dead credential, and the only releaser the queue has empties it. The
   * discard is not reported, for the same reason the kill switch's is not — it is the documented
   * one-time effect of retiring the web guest, not a loss anybody needs to be told about.
   *
   * The clear empties whatever the store holds when it runs, and the ordering that keeps this load's
   * records out of it is the `persistTask` link: the release takes it synchronously, before it
   * awaits anything, so every append behind that link — this flush's own, the coalescing timer's, a
   * page-hide one — lands in the cleared, unowned queue. On the first flush of a load that link is
   * normally taken before the coalescing timer has run, so what the clear takes is the retired
   * guest's events and nothing this load tracked. Normally, not always: an append can precede the
   * first release link, and what protects those records is the latch below rather than this
   * ordering. It does not promise those events leave on this flush: only what
   * `readOldestAnalyticsEvents` already saw is sent and a later append waits for the next flush, and
   * a signed-out browser sends nothing at all until the shared visitor identity has settled
   * (`canDeliverWithoutCredential`), which on a first visit is still a network `GET` away — the
   * flush behind `startVisitorIdentityResolution` is what ships them.
   *
   * A release the guard below defers past this load's first append would, whenever it finally ran,
   * take that append with it, and the guard really does turn from deferred into allowed inside one
   * document. `logged_in` is not written only by a navigation: the 401 answer to
   * `POST /api/refresh-session` clears it in place (`sessionRecovery.ts`, and
   * `clearBrowserSessionCookies` in `apps/auth/src/server/browserSession.ts`), the cookie is
   * `Lax`, non-`HttpOnly` and on the shared registrable domain, and `hasLoggedInCookie()` re-reads
   * it on every call. That same 401 path nulls the cached CSRF token afterwards, so the token is
   * not guaranteed to be the first of the four to clear either, and
   * `sessionOwnerPublisherCount` reaches zero without leaving the page when a render crash unmounts
   * `AppDataProvider` under a root `AppErrorBoundary`, either the one in `App.tsx` or the one
   * `main.tsx` mounts above `I18nProvider`.
   *
   * `hasPersistedUnderUnsettledQueueOwner` is what makes that safe instead of an ordering argument:
   * any persist that ran before this load settled the question blocks the clear for the rest of the
   * load, so the clear only ever discards records that predate the load running it. It latches on
   * the unanswered question rather than on the deferral, because the guard below is not the only way
   * to reach a flush that has not answered it — a release that was allowed and then threw leaves it
   * just as open, with this load's coalescing timer free to persist into the queue meanwhile. The
   * cost is that such a load's own events wait in the dead guest's queue — nothing can ship them
   * under that owner, and the later load that finally retires it discards them too — rather than
   * being deleted underneath the load that is still recording into them, unreported and mid-flight.
   *
   * `discardQueuedWork` is deliberately not used here: it also empties `pendingRecords`, which on a
   * first flush is exactly the cold `app_opened` and the first `screen_viewed`.
   *
   * Returns whether the flush may go on to persist and read. A failed read or a failed clear leaves
   * the owner in place, so the caller stops instead of appending this load's records to a queue that
   * is still going to be emptied; the next flush of this load asks again. Stopping the flush keeps
   * its own append out of the queue, and an append the coalescing timer made in between latches
   * instead, so that next attempt finds the question still open and refuses to clear rather than
   * taking the timer's records with it. That retry is deliberately not a `scheduleFlush(0)` from
   * here: a clear that kept failing would then reschedule itself at zero delay on every attempt.
