 *
 * A link in the corner opening the shared switch, rather than a route: `/settings/analytics` is
 * served by `AuthenticatedApp` and adding a second public route for the same screen would take the
 * settings screen away from the signed-in person it already serves, because a route declared above
 * `AuthenticatedApp` wins for everyone. Rendering the switch in place needs no route at all, which
 * is also why the public route list this reads stays the one `routes.ts` already publishes.
 *
 * Shown only once this browser is no longer waiting to be asked the cookie question — meaning it
 * stored an answer, or it is somewhere that asks nobody. It keeps the pre-decision silence intact
 * twice over: the link cannot appear while the strip is still asking, so the two never compete for
 * the same corner, and it never offers a cookie switch reading "on" to a browser whose question is
 * still open. The off switch is unreachable on a public route for as long as the strip is up, which
 * is the one answer away from being reachable and is preferred to two controls in one corner.
