 * because a banner that blocks the product is a banner people click through to get rid of, and an
 * answer given to make something go away is not much of an answer. Nothing is pre-selected,
 * dismissing it is not an option offered at all, and the two buttons sit side by side on one layer
 * at the same size. Allow wears the accent like every primary action in the app; Decline stays a
 * full button with full-contrast text, so refusing is never harder to find or to press than agreeing.
