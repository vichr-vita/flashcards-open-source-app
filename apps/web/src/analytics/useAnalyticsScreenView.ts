/**
 * Reports a screen whose identity is component state rather than a route, for the screens
 * `resolveAnalyticsSurface` cannot see: the steps of the catalog install flow, its sign-in gate, and
 * the friend invitation dialog. A gate that replaces the whole app root is not one of them — that is
 * decided in `App.tsx` and reported by `AnalyticsLifecycle`, so the route underneath is never
 * reported for a screen the gate kept from rendering.
 *
 * One `screen_viewed` per entry, which `trackScreenViewed` enforces for every caller rather than
 * this hook: React re-renders and re-runs effects for reasons that have nothing to do with the
 * person moving, and `analytics.product_events` is append-only, so a duplicate row is permanent.
 * Calling on every run is therefore safe and is what takes the stamp back after something else
 * moved it.
 *
 * `null` means no screen of this kind is on display. It reports nothing, and it hands the stamp back
 * to the route once this hook has reported something, because otherwise every later event — a
 * `sync_failed` from a background task included — would stay filed against a screen that is no
 * longer rendered. The ref is what makes that conditional: a hook whose surface has always been null
 * owns nothing and must not overwrite a surface some other screen set. The handover is silent, and
 * the visit stays open, so a surface that blinks through null and comes back — a panel waiting one
 * commit on data it already had — is one visit rather than two.
 *
 * The handover happens once and only while the stamp is still what this hook last set, which is what
 * keeps it from reaching past its own screen: React flushes a parent's passive effects after every
 * child's, so an unguarded null branch re-running on a later route change would overwrite whatever
 * another caller had just set.
